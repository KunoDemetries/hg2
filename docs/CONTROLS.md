# Keyboard controller

Press **F1** in the native game window to open or close the on-screen keyboard
reference. The title bar also shows `F1: Controls`. **Escape closes this panel**;
a separate Escape press with the panel closed exits the game. Holding Escape
while dismissing the panel will not also quit.

The reference is a host overlay, not the original pause menu. **The game keeps
running while it is open**, and live controller/keyboard input is released until
it closes. Pause with **Enter** before opening F1 when you need time to read it.

These are the native game's manual-mode defaults. Click the game window to focus it.
All original keyboard bindings are preserved; both analog sticks and all sixteen
DualShock2 button bits are available. A key press supplies full pressure (255)
for pressure-sensitive buttons and releases to zero.

Keyboard sticks use digital endpoints, not variable analog travel. Opposite keys
on an axis cancel to its center; diagonals and both sticks together are supported.
Losing focus releases all inputs. Physical-gamepad buttons combine with keyboard
buttons; a non-centered keyboard axis takes priority, otherwise the existing
physical-gamepad axis/deadzone applies. Physical gamepad support still needs user
validation.

For the user's suggested downward gameplay route, hold **S** for the left stick
or **Down Arrow** for the D-pad. Game-specific movement/actions still depend on
what the original game accepts at the current screen.

Recorded/hidden verification runs intentionally ignore live keyboard input. They
must not be mistaken for an interactive manual window. Keyboard bindings do not
change Project Link's controlled-pulse API, which currently exposes only Left,
Cross and Start. No global keyboard injection is used.

The window's video-update count is not independently measured gameplay FPS.
